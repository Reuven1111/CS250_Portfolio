- Sprint Review and Retrospective (Word Document)
- Agile Presentation (PowerPoint)
- Reflection on transitioning from Waterfall to Agile (ChadaTech Case Study)

## Reflection
In this course, I learned how Agile principles such as iterative development, Scrum roles, and sprint retrospectives can improve software quality and team collaboration. Transitioning from Waterfall to Agile enables faster feedback, adaptability, and client satisfaction.

Sprint Review and Retrospective Artifact

This repository includes the Sprint Review and Retrospective for SNHU Travel, which summarizes how Scrum roles, events, and artifacts were applied to deliver working software iteratively.

Portfolio Reflection
How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

I interpret user needs by breaking broad goals into clear, testable user stories. Each story expresses what the user wants and why it matters, which keeps development focused on real outcomes instead of assumptions. Writing user stories with acceptance criteria makes those needs measurable and easy to validate during reviews.

How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I approach development through short, iterative sprints that emphasize working software, feedback, and adaptability. Agile processes like sprint planning, daily scrums, reviews, and retrospectives help maintain transparency and constant improvement. In future projects, I plan to continue using Scrum practices such as vertical slicing, definition of done, and continuous integration to ensure consistent progress and quality.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

A good team member communicates openly, respects roles, and supports the team’s goals over personal preferences. That means raising blockers early, offering help when others are stuck, and being accountable for each commitment. Collaboration and trust are what turn individual effort into real team velocity.
